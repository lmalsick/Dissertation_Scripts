Purpose: CSV files were written off of the res_shrunk dataset made in R (see 02_scripts directory). This shrunk data refers to the apeglm shrinkage as shown in the MA plots in IV.1. 
Contains ALL genes, unfiltered besides removing genes with less than 10 counts. 

These gene lists can be used to filter for -0.5 < log2FC > 0.5 to replicate data as seen in Chapter 4.
